# try-autogen
testing out autogen - a multi-agent AI framework

before starting, create a .env file and add OPENAI_API_KEY=`<your-openai-key>`

```
make install
make run
```

Took the agents a bit of back and forth to get it but it did well.

The terminal output - showing discussion between the two agents is on [terminal-output](https://github.com/ryangaraygay/try-autogen/blob/main/terminal-output.txt).

The output as well as scripts/code the agents run are found in [output](https://github.com/ryangaraygay/try-autogen/tree/main/output).

This code example was inspired by (with some modification) from video "AutoGen Agents - Fast overview for beginners" by "Getting Started with Jeff". Available in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5iVvrkIk3s.
